# Apple Pie

A classic apple pie with a buttery, flaky crust. Inspired by Pillsbury recipes.

## Ingredients

- 2 refrigerated pie crusts 
- 6 cups thinly sliced, peeled apples (Granny Smith or your favorite)
- 3/4 cup sugar
- 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
- 3/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
- 1/8 teaspoon ground nutmeg
- 1/4 teaspoon salt
- 1 tablespoon lemon juice

## Instructions

1. **Preheat oven** to 425°F (220°C).
2. **Prepare the crust:** Place one pie crust in a 9-inch pie pan. Keep the second crust for the top.
3. **Mix the filling:** In a large bowl, combine sliced apples, sugar, flour, cinnamon, nutmeg, salt, and lemon juice. Toss gently to coat.
4. **Fill the pie:** Pour the apple mixture into the pie crust-lined pan. Dot the top with butter pieces.
5. **Add the top crust:** Cover with the second pie crust. Trim excess dough, pinch edges to seal, and cut slits in the top to allow steam to escape.
6. **Bake:** 40-45 minutes or until crust is golden brown and filling is bubbly. Check halfway through; if the edges brown too quickly, cover them with foil.

## Notes

- For a shinier crust, brush the top with a little milk or beaten egg before baking.
- You can substitute 1/4 cup brown sugar for 1/4 cup of white sugar for added depth of flavor.
- Serve with vanilla ice cream or whipped cream for extra indulgence.
